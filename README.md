A micro-ecommerce for household kitchens 

<P> NeighborCater has a simple goal - To allow household kitchens to become booming small businesses. Thousands of people in local communities look for outside food, when they'd much rather settle for cheaper, home-cooked food. NeighborCater allows this transaction to happen by placing kitchens on the forefront - listing what they make, their location, etc. Buyers can view each Kitchen, contact the "chef" through email and phone number, and eventually buy the item. The "chef" gets a notification of his/her orders and can manage what they are selling throughout the day, what's leftover.


NeighborCater is an iOS and an Android App. We were successfully able to replicate the app on both platforms, using Swift and Java, respectively, which proved much more difficult that we originally thought. Our primary backend was Firebase, holding the restaurant data, buyer info, orders, user authentication, and more. We utilized various CocoaPods and Online APIs including Google AutoComplete, XE.API and the Google Maps API for location address and currency conversion of prices.</p>
